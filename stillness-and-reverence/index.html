<p>Last week I attended
a performance: gentle afternoon rain.</p><p>It was warm enough
outside that my bedroom window was open. As I finished cooking some veggies in
the kitchen, I thought I heard a slight mist. It seemed so out of place with
how bright the sun had been shining most of the afternoon. "Is it raining,
Dino?" I asked my dog, as if he could confirm my suspicions. I walked into
the bedroom to see and there it was, rain falling softly, drawing me in closer
for the show. </p><p>Next thing I knew, I
found myself sitting at the foot of the bed, directly facing the window,
staring out and eating my lunch by the sound of the falling rain. </p><p>And there I sat.
Watching and listening with the reverence. Just as would be afforded the finest
of performances live at Her Majesty's Theatre. </p><p>My windowsill set
the frame like a stage, and the stillness outside was the backdrop that
featured the raindrops doing their thing.</p><p>I listened as the
drops all evenly fell. And as I finished eating my food, the rain started to
slow. A brief intermission to put down my bowl and let Dino hop up to snuggle
in my lap. And there we sat, watching the stillness out the window and
listening to the rain.</p><p>I breathed in deeply
and remembered the time I watched my dad stand at the open side door, looking
out through the screen at the rain, breathing deeply and taking in its scent.
Invisible swirls of goodness, in abundance for the receiving. I don't know if
he knew I was watching but the way he savored those moments with such purpose
and wonder changed something in me forever.</p><p>Still on my bed, I
listened as the rain accumulated. Larger drops began to fall on new things,
creating fancy rhythms and different sounds. And then came the small rushing
sound of tiny streams, flowing through the gutter or following the bend of the
curb. Until the showers began to taper once more and finally slow to a stop.
And with that, the show was over and the sun came out again.</p><p>So now as I relive
the story to share it with you, I notice that the experience doesn't feel small
and yet it doesn't feel especially large. Instead it feels softly satisfying.
Which, perhaps this quiet intensity, I muse, is the mightiest power there is.
From stillness and softness comes the strength.</p><p>It seems life is
just waiting for us to offer it the reverence it deserves. Not out of a desire
for selfish recognition but because it knows the nourishment that will be
brought to our souls and the contentment that will fill our hearts. It knows
that it will stir things within us and unlock new secrets of who we are. And
what pure and generous love is this, to want us to see its beauty only so that
we may feel and know our own.</p><p>Ah, I'm going to
rest in that today. And I hope somehow you can, too. Because the performance is
always happening. It's up to us to listen to the whisper that calls us to its
display. </p><p>Sending love you to
as we listen for the whisper,</p><p>Caitlin</p><p>
